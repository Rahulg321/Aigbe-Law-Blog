        Your Going Public Transaction with Us
      </h4>
      <p>
        In an initial public offering (IPO), a company goes public directly by
        filing an S-1 registration statement for the public sale of its stock.
        That sale of stock can be by the company using an underwriter, which is
        known as an IPO. Alternatively, many issuers are choosing to
        self-underwrite their public offerings, commonly referred to as a Direct
        Public Offering (DPO). But of course, the process is highly regulated
        and without experienced legal counsel can be difficult, expensive and
        time-consuming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pursuant to Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
        (“Securities Act”), it is unlawful to “offer” or “sell” securities
        without a valid effective registration statement, unless an exemption is
        available. Companies desiring to offer and sell securities to the public
        must file with the SEC and provide prospective investors all material
        information concerning the company and the securities offered. The
        Securities Act sets forth in-depth rules on what constitutes material
        information, and on what forms and in what format that material
        information must be disclosed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rule 404(a) of the Securities Act sets forth the basic requirements for
        a registration statement. Rule 404(a) reads in part:
      </p>
      <p>
        “A registration statement shall consist of the facing sheet of the
        applicable form; a prospectus containing the information called for by
        Part 1 of such form; the information, list of exhibits, undertakings and
        signatures required to be set forth in Part II of such form; financial
        statements and schedules; exhibits; any other information or documents
        filed as part of the registration statement; and all documents or
        information incorporated by reference in the foregoing.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years the SEC has created and eliminated various registration
        forms. Currently all domestic issuers must use either form S-1 or S-3.
        Form S-3 is limited to larger filers with a minimum of $75 million in
        non-affiliate public float, among other requirements. All other issuers
        must use form S-1.
      </p>
      <h4 className="underline text-mainB my-[1em]">
        There are four primary regulations governing the preparation and filing
        of Form S-1:
      </h4>
      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside p-4 space-y-2 md:space-y-4">
        <li>
          {" "}
          Regulation C – contains the general requirements for preparing and
          filing the Form S-1. Included within Regulation C are regulations and
          procedures related to (a) the treatment of confidential information;
          (b) amending a registration statement prior to effectiveness; (c)
          procedures to file a post-effective amendment; and (d) the “Plain
          English” rule
        </li>
        <li>
          Regulation S-T – requires that all registration statements, exhibits
          and documents be electronically filed through the SEC’s EDGAR system
          and must include interactive data using the XBRL process.
        </li>
        <li>
          Regulation S-K – sets forth, in detail, all the disclosure
          requirements for all the sections of the S-1. Regulation S-K is the
          who, what, where, when and how requirements to complete the S-1.
        </li>
        <li>
          Regulation S-X – sets forth the requirements with respect to the form
          and content of financial statements to be filed with the SEC.
          Regulation S-X includes general rules applicable to the preparation of
          all financial statements and specific rules pertaining to particular
          industries and types of businesses.
        </li>
        <li>
          Both the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”) and the
          Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”) provide
          remedies to investors in the IPO and DPO process. The basic premise of
          such liability is that either an investor was not given an opportunity
          to review investment disclosure documents prior to making the
          investment, or such disclosure documents contained inaccurate
          information or failed to contain material information. The bottom line
          is that if an officer or director signs a registration statement which
          is filed with the SEC and which contains misstatements or fails to
          contain material information, they may be subject to liability on two
          fronts – from the SEC in an enforcement proceeding, and from
          individuals and entities in a private civil claim.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4 className="underline text-mainB my-[1em]">
        Private Placement Followed by Registration of Securities
      </h4>
      <p>
        A public company, by definition, has public shareholders. Reverse
        mergers, IPO’s and DPO’s all result in a public shareholder base.
        Another option for a company going public directly is to complete a
        private placement; selling shares to unaffiliated third parties and then
        filing an S-1 resale registration statement as to those shares. Each of
        these options results in an unaffiliated public shareholder base. Simply
        stated, all of these aforementioned processes result in a company going
        public.
      </p>
      <p>
        The S-1 resale registration statement filed on behalf of selling
        shareholders contains substantially the same required information as an
        S-1 registration statement filed on behalf of the company itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main benefit to a private company going public through the filing of
        an S-1 Registration Statement as opposed to a reverse merger is that the
        company does not have to be concerned about undisclosed, potential or
        contingent liabilities. Moreover, the SEC rules relating to shell
        companies (such as Rule 144 and Rule 145) prevent the operating
        company’s shareholders from selling stock using the Rule 144 exemption
        for twelve months following the completion of the merger. Furthermore,
        companies completing a reverse merger may face reputational challenges.
        Finally, if not completed correctly, the newly merged entity may face
        trading difficulties with either or both FINRA and DTC.

        Listing on a National Exchange
      </h4>
      <p>
        There are currently registered stock exchanges in the United States,
        however, the most common exchanges for small cap and middle market
        companies are the NYSE including the NYSE American and NASDAQ. Both
        exchanges have quantitative and qualitative listing standards and
        ongoing corporate governance requirements for listed companies. For a
        complete list of NYSE American listing requirements see my blog on the
        topic HERE and for a complete list of NASDAQ listing requirements see by
        blog HERE. The attorneys at Anthony, Linder & Cacomanolis, PLLC assist
        companies with the preparation for and application process to list on an
        exchange as well as compliance with ongoing listing requirements.
      </p>
      <h4 className="underline text-mainB my-[1em]">FINRA and DTC</h4>
      <p>
        For companies going public on the OTC Markets, following the
        effectiveness of the S-1 registration statement, the company will need
        to engage the services of a market maker to file a 15c2-11 application
        with FINRA to obtain permission to quote and trade the stock and to
        receive a trading symbol. FINRA is the self-regulatory body which
        overseas trading on the over-the-counter market. On the most basic
        level, FINRA issues trading symbols to company’s trading on the
        over-the-counter market (including the Pink Sheets, OTCQB and OTCQX).

      <p>
        The Depository Trust Company (DTC) provides the clearing and settlement
        services for all the electronic trading of securities in the United
        States. Over the past year, DTC eligibility has become a concern for
        many OTC issuers. The DTC has become active in reviewing the securities
        of issuers and requiring that an issuer be able to prove, to the DTC’s
        satisfaction, that all shares trading electronically are indeed legally
        entitled to do so. This includes shares that may have been issued in a
        predecessor company many years before and for which records may not be
        available.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obtaining and maintaining eligibility is of the utmost importance for
        the smooth trading of an issuer’s float in the secondary market.
        Moreover, DTC eligibility is a prerequisite for OTC issuers’
        shareholders to deposit securities with their brokers and have such
        securities be placed in street name.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anthony, Linder & Cacomanolis, PLLC stays current with all DTC issuer
        requirements to assist clients in avoiding unnecessary disruptions to
        their stocks trading activity and to remove DTC chills and locks
        whenever possible.

        Going Public Via Reverse Merger
      </h4>
      <p>
        A reverse merger transaction is one in which a private operating entity
        merges with a public shell company, resulting in the private operating
        company becoming public. Generally, the shareholders of the private
        operating company will exchange their ownership in the private company
        for a majority stake in the public shell company. A “shell company” is
        an entity that has no or nominal operations and no assets or assets
        consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents. A reverse merger is an
        alternative method of going public (as opposed to an IPO, DPO or private
        placement followed by the registration process).
      </p>
      <p>
        A reverse merger is often structured as a reverse triangular merger. In
        that case, the public shell forms a new subsidiary which new subsidiary
        merges with the private operating business. At the closing, the private
        company shareholders still exchange their ownership for shares in the
        public company and the private operating business becomes a wholly owned
        subsidiary of the public company. The primary benefit of the reverse
        triangular merger is the ease of shareholder consents. That is because
        the sole shareholder of the acquiring entity is the public company. The
        directors of the public company can approve the transaction on behalf of
        the acquiring subsidiary, avoiding the necessity of meeting the proxy
        requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
      </p>
      <p>
        The advantages of a reverse merger revolve around time. A reverse merger
        transaction can be completed very quickly and efficiently. The
        disadvantages of a reverse merger generally revolve around undisclosed
        prior issues or liabilities with the public shell, including issues that
        could affect DTC eligibility. This primary disadvantage can be addressed
        by hiring competent securities counsel to assist with the due diligence
        process. Another disadvantage involves cost; a reverse merger
        transaction, although substantially quicker than an IPO, can cost
        substantially more. In addition to legal and accounting fees, a private
        entity must purchase the public shell itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like any transaction involving the sale of securities, the issuance of
        securities to the private company shareholders must either be registered
        under Section 5 of the Securities Act or by subject to an available
        exemption from registration. Generally, shell companies rely on Section
        4(2) or Rule 506 of Regulation D under the Securities Act for such
        exemption.
      </p>
      <p>
        A reverse merger is a going public transaction but not a capital raising
        transaction. Generally companies completing a reverse merger
        simultaneously complete a private placement transaction for fund
        raising.
